              <h4>About us...</h4>
              <p>Yottabyte is a craft chocolate and candy retailer located in Smithtown, New York. Our small boutique is located in the historic district of Village of the Branch, in the original Smithtown School house where American Poet Walt Whitman taught.
                  <br/><br/>
                  We have made a commitment to promote socially responsible chocolate and candy makers. We offer complimentary chocolate tastings to our customers to demonstrate the difference between candy chocolate and craft chocolate. Yottabyte shares the stories of social inequality in cacao production, because educating our community about cacao production is the key step to reach our ultimate goal, to sell 100% ethically produced chocolate.</p>
